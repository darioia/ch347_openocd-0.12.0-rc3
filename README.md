# ch347_openocd-0.12.0-rc3

For build the openocd application is need to use libch347.so library present in
CH347Par_Linux_V1.02_HID.zip downloaded from:
https://github.com/wuxx/USB-HS-Bridge/tree/master/doc

Also the linux driver (if needed) is present there, I have patched the all warning
but not still released it.
